Style has two parts.
1. Selector
2. Definition.

Definition part specify the styles.
Selector is the section which identifies the elements for which the defined style has to be applied.

Styles will inherit from higher level tag to inner level tag.

Relationship selectors
----------------------
Select elements based on the relationship of those elements with other elements.
Either class or element relationship can be used.

descendent selectors :- Any element of one type that is descendent of another.
  body span {
    //Any span element under body will get selected.
  }
  body .thumbnail-title{
  // any element with specified class which is descendent of body.
  }

Child selectors :- Select the immediate children of a type. It uses a combiner >
    li > span {
    //Any span which is immediate child of li.
    }
Sibling selector :- uses ~ combiner.
    header ~ ul {
     //any ul element preceded by header element. Ul element coming before header will not be selected.
    }
Adjacent sibling selector :- Uses + combiner.
    li + li {
      //Select all li elements which is immediately preceded by another li element.
    }


Class select uses . predix. ID selector uses # as prefix. ID selector has higher specificity than class selector and type selector has lowest.

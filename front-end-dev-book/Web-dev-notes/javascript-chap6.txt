For CSS we use class names to select elements. For java scripts use data attributes.

Data attributes starts with data-

Technically we can use CSS class names for java script and use data elements for CSS. But not a best practice.


Whenever we need to change the styles dynamically, one approach is to add a new class name to an ancestor component and declare styles as a combination.
Eg.

.hidden-detail .thumbnail-list{
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

These style will apply to .thumbnail-list class element only if the ancestor has hidden-detail class applied.
